Since [the last time I wrote about logging]({% post_url 2014-10-26-logging-from-net-library %}),
Microsoft appears to be working on [something totally new](https://github.com/aspnet/Logging)
as part of ASP.NET vNext.

They even implement [adapters to Serilog and NLog](https://github.com/aspnet/Logging/tree/dev/src)
on their own... Another instance of Microsoft opening up to the outside open source world.

And a related feature: [A new [AssemblyNeutral] attribute](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Assembly-Neutral-Interfaces)
that allows true duck typing in .NET.
